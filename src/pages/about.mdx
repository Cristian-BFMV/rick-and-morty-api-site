### What is this?
The Rick and Morty API (or ShlaAPI) is a RESTful and GraphQL API based on the television show [Rick and Morty](https://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty).
You will have access to about hundreds of characters, images, locations and episodes. The Rick and Morty API is filled with canonical information as seen on the TV show.

Season 4 characters, locations and episodes are coming soon!

[Check out the documentation to get started](/documentation)

### Who are you?
I am [Axel Fuhrmann](https://axelfuhrmann.com/), a guy who likes to develop things and make music.

### Did you build the API alone?
No, [Talita](https://talitatraveler.com) is in charge of the research, data collection and data entry.

### Why did you build this?
Because I was really interested in the idea of writing an API and also because Rick and Morty is our favorite show at the moment, so why not?

### Are you a native english speaker?
No, I am not. If you find typos, grammar errors or whatever please feel free to [PR](https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api-site) or send me an [email](mailto:axelfuh@gmail.com).

### Technical stuff?
I'm using [Node](https://nodejs.org) to serve the API, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/) to manage the databases. All the data is formatted in [json](http://json.org/) and I'm hosting the entire project on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/2736d3ffe622).

### Can I contribute to the project?
Of course, the API is an open source project and you can contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api).

### Copyright?
Rick and Morty is created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for [Adult Swim](https://www.adultswim.com). The data and images are used without claim of ownership and belong to their respective owners.

This API is open source and uses a BSD license. All the data has been collected from open sources such as [http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/).
